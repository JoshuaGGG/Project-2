            <h2>What is a cyber attack?</h2>
            <p>A cyber attack is a well thought out plan by cyber criminals in order to infiltrate and assault a person through the use of a computer or network. Cyber criminals are referred to as a
                 personal group or in general as hackers.  More than ever there has been an increase of cyber attacks making headlines as humans are more reliant on technology for their everyday needs. 
                 Whether it is using a phone to communicate with a relative or from making a purchase online with a computer it is clear that the pervasiveness of cyber attacks are growing exponentially.
                  The motivation to sheme a devious cyber attack can be for political, criminal, or personal plans to gain access to very serious information. Cyber attacks in most cases will ruin a 
                  reputation to a person with the manipulation of data being hampered and manipulated.</p>
